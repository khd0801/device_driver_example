# Linux-Device-Driver

Examples of Linux Device Drivers, currently for kernel 5.10.

# Before start

The examples in this repo are compiled against Linux Kernel 5.10. Other versions
of kernel are not tested.

Set `KERNELDIR` environment variable to the Linux kernel source dir, and export
it in your local shell.

```bash
export KERNELDIR=/path/to/kernel/source/
```

This environment variable is mainly used in Makefile to determine which the
kernel source tree the drivers are built against.

# Introduction

This repo demonstrates basic examples of Linux Device Driver(LDD) for
the purpose of study and sharing.

Some of examples in this repo are excepted from the book of 
LDD3(Linux Device Drivers, Third Edition), and the other examples are written
by myself in necessary to illustrate some important data structures or details.

LDD3 is a great book, which is authored by Jonathan Corbet, Alessandro Rubini,
and Greg Kroah-Hartman, I give my sincerely appreciation to all these authors
for their great work.

LDD3 is available online, and you may request a copy of PDF from
[https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/]. It is still an excellent book for reference for
the development of Linux Driver. However, due to its old age, first published
in 2005, some of the APIs and data structures have dramatically changed after
it was firstly composed.

Compare to the Kernel 2.6.10, which is a base of LDD3 book, I rewrite all the
examples for a brand new Kernel version 5.10, released in Decemeber 2020.
Besides kernel version, hardware also evolved a lot in recently years. The
parallel port, which is used as an example in I/O operations in LDD3, can be
barely found in any computer now. I moved these examples to a QEMU(A generic
and open source machine emulator and virtualizer) virtual machine, in which 
a virtual parallel port device is implemented for convenient debugging.

This is the opening of my whole project, I hope you will enjoy in the tour
of reading my documents.

Thanks a lot.

Sincerely, Douglas.
